# Landing-Page-Project

Project provided an opportunity for me to use the HTML and CSS skills that were taught up until that point. It provided a deeper understanding on how to utilize flexbox well - specifically understanding the use of containers. It is the second project of The Odin Project that requires you to create something from scratch. This one being more technical with CSS being added in. It had tested my problem-solving skills when trying to get my own project to match the image provided by making use of many containers to ensure everything was in the right place. Also required some research to create certain sections since some things weren't taught.

If you would like more information on the project, please refer to "Project: Landing Page" from the Foundations Course on The Odin Project site.
